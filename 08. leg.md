# **leg**

First, we get the [source code](http://pwnable.kr/bin/leg.c) and [asm code](http://pwnable.kr/bin/leg.asm) from the question.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int key1(){
	asm("mov r3, pc\\n");
}
int key2(){
	asm(
	"push	{r6}\\n"
	"add	r6, pc, $1\\n"
	"bx	r6\\n"
	".code   16\\n"
	"mov	r3, pc\\n"
	"add	r3, $0x4\\n"
	"push	{r3}\\n"
	"pop	{pc}\\n"
	".code	32\\n"
	"pop	{r6}\\n"
	);
}
int key3(){
	asm("mov r3, lr\\n");
}
int main(){
	int key=0;
	printf("Daddy has very strong arm! : ");
	scanf("%d", &key);
	if( (key1()+key2()+key3()) == key ){
		printf("Congratz!\\n");
		int fd = open("flag", O_RDONLY);
		char buf\[100\];
		int r = read(fd, buf, 100);
		write(0, buf, r);
	}
	else{
		printf("I have strong leg :P\\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

As you see the major part is `if( (key1()+key2()+key3()) == key )`, the `key` is which we input to it.

So, let's count the sum of those three value.

This [post](http://blog.csdn.net/yanlinembed/article/details/50595848) will be helpful to this question.

For `key1`, it is assigned value of `pc`, then `pc` is always pointing to No.2 command 
line's address after it called.

So, here `pc` is `0x00008ce4` + `0x8`.

For `key2`, `adds` means to write the result to CPSR(R16, a temp value to store the result for next command to use), therefore, `r3` is still has the same value as it assigned by `pc`.

So, here `pc` is `0x00008d04` + `0x8`.

For `key3`, `lr` means the return address when this function has been called.

Here we got that function `key3()` was called by `main()` at `0x00008d7c`, so `lr` is point to address `0x00008d80`, same value to `r3` & `r0` & `key3`.

Use python or online translator to count the value of `key1()+key2()+key3()`.

`0x00008ce4` + `0x8` +` 0x00008d04` + `0x8` + `0x00008d80` = `108400`

Then, use ssh to connect to the server.

`ls` to find the process's name.

Execute it and input the value.
